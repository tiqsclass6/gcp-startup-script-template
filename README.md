# GCP Basic Webserver Startup Script

This Repository contains a basic shell script which is used to confirm the availability of cloud based web applications. 

This script is written to work in the basic GCP iteration of linux using Apache2, and serves as a basic web server for testing infrastructure. 

The Metadata of the host instance is also included for testing purposes. 

Feel free to edit and change this file at your whim :)
